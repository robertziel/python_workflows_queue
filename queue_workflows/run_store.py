"""Minimal run-row read/write over ``workflow_runs`` — the engine's run-state
seam (the ``repo`` inversion, plan §1d-A).

``workflow_runs`` is the DAG-run record and the queue's substrate: the engine
created it (migration 0001) and several engine modules read/write it —
``dispatcher`` (get/update on completion/failure), ``node_executor`` (get for
the out_dir + context), ``cancel_watcher`` (poll status), ``node_pool``
(update on expand). This module is that minimal psycopg surface. It is a LEAF:
it imports only ``db`` (the pool) — nothing up the engine stack — so
``dispatcher``/``node_pool`` can import it without a cycle.

A host that joins ``workflow_runs`` to its own tables (parcels, Rails views)
keeps its own ORM views of the SAME table; this is the project's established
"two ORMs, one Postgres" pattern. The engine deliberately treats ``parcel_id``
as an opaque nullable column (the engine's migration 0001 drops the parcels
FK), so ``run_store`` never needs to know about the host's domain.

    watchdog hard-exit, or an operator fleet-restart) without marking its node
    terminal. Such a run must go back to the queue so it can finish — possibly
    on a *different* host (e.g. the Blackwell qwen stall hangs a box-c but
    completes on host-c). The old behaviour capped at 5 resumes then marked the

    run with a healthy one that merely rode through restarts/host-specific hangs
    — and killed the healthy case. ``resume_count`` is still bumped (visibility:
    an operator can spot a run stuck resuming and cancel it), but it no longer
    trips an auto-fail. Genuine node failures still fail the run via the normal
